# CO528-Assesment-1
This is my work for my CO528: Introduction to Intelligent Systems Assessment 1 in which I had to create genetic algorithms to solve two problems. 
Please Note: Lots of this code is very repetitive and normally I would clean it up with some interfaces/abstract classes etc.

## Problem 1
The first problem is a black box function that takes 20 real-valued numbers as input. The function has a unique minimum fitness of 0 for a specific input. Your task is to write a genetic algorithm to find this minimum value. You can safely assume that the minimum can be found for input values between -5.0 and +5.0 for all variables/dials. So, you do not need to search smaller or larger values than that.

## Problem 2
The second problem is a version of the well-known knapsack problem. The idea is that you want to pack a bag. You have 100 items that you would like to take with you. Each item has a utility value and a weight (assumed to be expressed in kg). You want to maximise your utility (which is the sum of the utilities of all the items you take with you) but you are not allowed to pack more than 500 kgs of weight altogether. This means that you need to choose the items that maximise your total utility while staying within the weight limit.
